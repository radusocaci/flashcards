# FlashCards - E-learning application

FlashCards is an e-learning application designed for mobile devices. I was part of the team responsible for creating FlashCards, directly mentored by an experienced .NET engineer at [NetMatch](https://www.netmatch.nl/). This application was developed in 2016 as part of a nation-wide programme for high-school students called [DPIT](https://dpit.ro/despre-noi/) where we ended up taking 5th place.

From a technology stack standpoint, we used C# as the main programming language, Nancy for the back-end related logic and Ratchet to facilitate the use of the application on a mobile device, through the browser. However, the application can be greatly improved. Possible extensions would be: adding a database and improving the way learning content is stored, converting the application to a PWA (Progressive Web App), etc.
